### modules folder
* All modules are stored here. Each module will have screens, components common to it.
* Each screen will have a style file and a service file of its own.
* style file will have its styles.
* service file will have the logical funtions including hooks into it. This strategy is to keep UI and logic separate so code is more modular.
